🚀 Excited to share my latest project!

I’ve built a Film Name Prediction Game using JavaFX and MySQL 🎬.
The idea is simple but fun: the user predicts the film’s name based on the actor provided. To make it more engaging, I added a hint system to guide the player when things get tricky.

💡 Key highlights:

Developed with JavaFX for a smooth and interactive UI

Data stored and managed efficiently using MySQL

Features include film guessing, actor-based hints, and a clean, game-like experience

This project helped me sharpen my skills in:
✔️ JavaFX UI development
✔️ Database integration with MySQL
✔️ Game logic design and user interaction

I’m really proud of how it turned out, and I look forward to expanding it further — maybe adding more advanced hints, scoring systems, or even multiplayer support in the future!
